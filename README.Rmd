The goal of natverse is to install all of the commonly used NeuroAnatomy Toolbox packages.

See https://natverse.github.io for more details.

## Installation

You can install the latest version as shown below:

```r
if(!requireNamespace('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("natverse/natverse")
```

Once installed, you can update the elements of the natverse package and its dependecies like:

```r
natverse_update(update = TRUE, install_missing = TRUE,dep = TRUE)
```
This will ask you to confirm whether you want to update dependencies (and their dependencies).

If want to upgrade the natverse package itself:

```r
remotes::update_packages('natverse')
```

## Example

This will load the `natverse` package:

```{r example}
library(natverse)
```

Conflicts between functions added to the search path by loading the `natverse` and equivalently named functions in other packages can by running:

```{r conflicts}
natverse_conflicts()
```

You can check if all the packages within `natverse` are up to date with:

```{r check status}
natverse_deps()
```
